# Kotedex

This is my working client side app for http://pokeapi.co/. It was created using ReactJS to render a static `index.html` page which represents info about pokemons. Just follow this link <b>http://maxpenderuk.github.io/kotedex</b> to see how it looks like.

### Installation
```sh
$ mkdir Projects
$ cd Projects/
$ git clone https://github.com/MaxPenderuk/kotedex.git
$ npm install
```

### To start the app locally:
```sh
$ npm start
```
Then check for http://localhost:3000 link in your browser.
