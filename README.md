# Kotedex

This is my working client side app for http://pokeapi.co/, which was created using ReactJS. Just follow the <b>http://maxpenderuk.github.io/kotedex</b> link to see how it looks like. Also try to click on any pokemon to get its info.

### Installation
```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/MaxPenderuk/kotedex.git
    $ cd kotedex/
    $ npm install
```

### To start the app locally:
```bash
    $ npm start
```

### To create a build:

```

Then check for http://localhost:3000 link in your browser.
